A plugin that allows you to add WordPress.org plugins and themes as downloads in Easy Digital Downloads.

== Description ==
This plugin allows you to add WordPress.org plugins and themes as free downloads in Easy Digital Downloads.

When you specify a WordPress.org plugin or theme URL, the add to cart and buy now buttons will link to the WordPress.org plugin or theme, and will display as "Free Download" buttons instead.

This plugin will also add a helpful widget which displays info such as the download count, dates added/last updated, current version, and more. This info is cached via transients so it will work well on high traffic servers.

== Installation ==
Install this plugin like you would install any other WordPress plugin.

Dashboard Method:

1. Login to your WordPress admin and go to Plugins -> Add New
2. Type "EDD WordPress.org Downloads" in the search bar and select this plugin
3. Click "Install", and then "Activate Plugin"


Upload Method:

1. Unzip the plugin and upload the "edd-wordpress-downloads" folder to your "wp-content/plugins" directory
